"""The symbolic vocabulary SH parsers are expected to produce.

Core hyperbase treats subtypes as opaque, arbitrarily extensible strings (see
``docs/manual/notation.md``): ``union/Pmath`` is a perfectly legal atom. Parsers
are held to a stricter contract -- the single-character subtypes of the notation
tables, the narrow argrole sets, and a fixed inventory of special atoms in the
reserved ``.`` namespace. This module is the one place those inventories are
written down; :mod:`hyperbase.parsers.correctness` enforces them and parser
plugins (e.g. ``hyperparser.types``) build their label vocabularies from them.
