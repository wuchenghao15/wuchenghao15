from coreference_module import CoreferenceResolver

class TestYourFeature:
    def test_basic_case(self):

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints where appropriate

```python
# Good
def resolve_pronoun(pronoun: str, context: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Resolve a pronoun to its antecedent."""
    ...

# Avoid
def rp(p, c):
    ...
```

## Comments and Documentation

- **All comments must be in English** (for international accessibility)
- Use docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep comments concise and meaningful

```python
def _find_replacement(self, pronoun: str, ...) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Find the appropriate replacement for a pronoun.
    
    Args:
        pronoun: The pronoun to resolve
        ...
    
    Returns:
        The replacement text, or None if no resolution possible
    """
```

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in imperative mood
- Keep the first line under 72 characters

```
Good:
- Add support for event pronouns
- Fix incorrect gender matching in possessive resolution
- Update README with new API examples
