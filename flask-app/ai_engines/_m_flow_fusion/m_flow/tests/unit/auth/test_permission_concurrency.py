"""
Tests for concurrent permission creation.

These tests verify that the get_or_create_permission helper function
correctly handles race conditions when multiple concurrent requests
attempt to create the same permission.

Note: SQLite has strict table-level locking for writes, which limits
concurrent testing. In production with PostgreSQL, concurrent writes
work correctly. These tests use serialization where needed to work
around SQLite limitations while still validating the core logic.
