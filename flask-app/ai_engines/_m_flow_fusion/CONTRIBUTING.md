## How to Contribute

We welcome every kind of contribution:

- **Bug reports** — open an issue with a minimal reproducer
- **Feature proposals** — describe the use-case and expected behaviour
- **Documentation** — fix typos, add examples, improve clarity
- **Code & tests** — implement fixes, features, or new adapters
- **Code review** — comment on open PRs with constructive feedback

## Development Setup

### 1. Fork & Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/m_flow.git
cd m_flow
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

We recommend **uv** for fast, reproducible installs:

```bash
uv sync --dev --all-extras --reinstall
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature dev
```

### 4. Run the Test Suite

```bash
# Unit tests (fast, no network)
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest m_flow/tests/unit/ -v

# Full suite (may need LLM keys in .env)
PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest m_flow/tests/ -v
```

## 5. Lint & Format

```bash
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .
```

Fix any issues before committing.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Sign your commits** — we enforce the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin):
   ```bash
   git commit -s -m "feat(graph): add temporal edge weighting"
   ```
2. **Push and open a PR against `dev`**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/my-awesome-feature
   ```
3. Fill in the PR template. Include:
   - What changed and why
   - How you tested it locally
   - Any impacts on MCP server or frontend

### PR Title Convention

| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test` | Adding or correcting tests |
| `chore` | Tooling, CI, build changes |
