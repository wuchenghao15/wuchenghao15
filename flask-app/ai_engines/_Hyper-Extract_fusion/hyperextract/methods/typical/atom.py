Atom_FACTOID_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Observation Date: {observation_time}

You are an expert factoid extraction engine. Your primary function is to read a news paragraph and its associated observation date, and then decompose the text into a comprehensive list of atomic, self-contained, and temporally-grounded facts.

## Task
Given an input paragraph and an `observation_time`, generate a list of all distinct factoids present in the text.

## Guidelines for Generating Temporal Factoids

### 1. Atomic Factoids
- Convert compound or complex sentences into short, single-fact statements
- Each factoid must contain exactly one piece of information or relationship
- Ensure that each factoid is expressed directly and concisely, without redundancies or duplicating the same information across multiple statements
- **Example:** "Unsupervised learning is dedicated to discovering intrinsic patterns in unlabeled datasets" becomes "Unsupervised learning discovers patterns in unlabeled data"

### 2. Decontextualization
- Replace pronouns (e.g., "it," "he," "they") with the full entity name or a clarifying noun phrase
- Include any necessary modifiers so that each factoid is understandable in isolation

### 3. Temporal Context
- Convert ALL time references to absolute dates/times using the observation_time

#### Conversion Rules:
- "today" → exact observation_time
- "yesterday" → observation_time minus 1 day
- "this week" → Monday of observation_time's week
- "last week" → Monday of the week before observation_time
- "this month" → first day of observation_time's month
- "last month" → first day of the month before observation_time
- "this year" → January 1st of observation_time's year
- "last year" → January 1st of the year before observation_time
- Keep explicit dates as-is (e.g., "June 18, 2024")

#### Additional Temporal Guidelines:
- Position time references naturally within factoids
- Split sentences with multiple time references into separate factoids
- **NEVER include relative terms like "today," "yesterday," "last week" in the final factoids**

### 4. Accuracy & Completeness
- Preserve the original meaning without combining multiple facts into a single statement
- Avoid adding details not present in the source text

### 5. End Actions
- If the text indicates the end of a role or an action (for example, someone leaving a position), be explicit about the role/action and the time it ended

### 6. Redundancies
- Eliminate redundancies by simplifying phrases
- **Example:** Convert "the method is crucial for maintaining X" into "the method maintains X"

## Example

**Input:** "On June 18, 2024, Real Madrid won the Champions League final with a 2-1 victory. Following the triumph, fans of Real Madrid celebrated the Champions League victory across the city."

**Output:**
- Real Madrid won the Champions League final on June 18, 2024
- The Champions League final ended with a 2-1 victory for Real Madrid on June 18, 2024
- Fans of Real Madrid celebrated the Champions League victory across the city on June 18, 2024

# Atom FACToid prompt ends, edge prompt begins
Atom_EDGE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
Observation Date: {observation_time}

You are a precise knowledge extraction engine designed to distill unstructured text into a structured Knowledge Graph.
Your goal is to extract all meaningful relationships (edges) between entities, while rigorously capturing their temporal bounds and grounding evidence.

### Objective
Extract a list of relationships where each relationship consists of:
1. **Start Node**: The subject entity (Name + Label).
2. **End Node**: The object entity (Name + Label).
3. **Relation Name**: A canonical, present-tense predicate (e.g., 'works_at', 'is_CEO_of').
4. **Time Start (`t_start`)**: Strategies for when the relation began.
5. **Time End (`t_end`)**: Strategies for when the relation ended.
6. **Evidence (`atomic_facts`)**: The exact source sentences/facts supporting this edge.

### 🎯 Guidelines

#### 1. Entity & Relation Standards
- **Entities**: Extract precise names (e.g., "Apple Inc.", "Steve Jobs"). Assign accurate semantic labels (e.g., "Organization", "Person").
- **Relations**: use **SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE** verbs only (e.g., use 'manages', NOT 'managed', 'was_managing', or 'will_manage').
- **Forbidden**: Do NOT use vague prepositions like "in", "of", "at" as relation names. Use descriptive verbs instead (e.g., "located_in", "part_of").

#### 2. Temporal Extraction (Critical)
- **Format**: All dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY` format.
- **Lists**: `t_start` and `t_end` must always be lists of strings. If no date is found, use an empty list `[]`.
- **Relative Time Resolution**: Calculate absolute dates based on the **Observation Date** ({observation_time}).
    - "last year" -> {observation_time} year - 1 (Jan 1st)
    - "a few months ago" -> Estimate conservatively based on context.
    - "currently" -> implies the relationship is active (no `t_end`).
- **End Actions**: If the text says someone "left" or "stopped", capture this in `t_end` while keeping the relation positive (e.g., Relation: "works_at", t_end: ["2023-01-01"]).
- **t_obs**: Always set `t_obs` to null (or empty). Do not try to guess it.

#### 3. Evidence Attribution (atomic_facts)
- For every relationship extracted, identify the specific sentence(s) or atomic fact(s) in the source text that provide the evidence.
- **COPY EXACTLY**: Populate the `atomic_facts` list with the exact strings from the input text.
- **NO Paraphrasing**: Do not summarize or rewrite the source text in this field.
- If a relationship is derived from multiple facts, include all distinct facts in the list.

### 📝 Few-Shot Examples

**Input**: "Michel served as CFO at Acme Corp from 2019 to 2021. He was hired by Beta Inc in 2021, but left that role in 2023."
**Output**:
- (Michel, is_CFO_of, Acme Corp, t_start=["2019-01-01"], t_end=["2021-01-01"], atomic_facts=["Michel served as CFO at Acme Corp from 2019 to 2021."])
- (Michel, works_at, Beta Inc, t_start=["2021-01-01"], t_end=["2023-01-01"], atomic_facts=["He was hired by Beta Inc in 2021, but left that role in 2023."])

**Input**: "Sarah was a board member of GreenFuture until 2019."
**Output**:
- (Sarah, is_board_member_of, GreenFuture, t_start=[], t_end=["2019-01-01"], atomic_facts=["Sarah was a board member of GreenFuture until 2019."])

**Input**: "(Observation Date: 2024-06-15) John Doe is no longer the CEO of GreenIT since a few months ago."
**Output**:
- (John Doe, is_CEO_of, GreenIT, t_start=[], t_end=["2024-03-15"], atomic_facts=["John Doe is no longer the CEO of GreenIT since a few months ago."])
  *(Reasoning: "a few months ago" from June is approx. March)*

**Input**: "John Doe's marriage is happening on 26-02-2026."
**Output**:
- (John Doe, has_status, Married, t_start=["2026-02-26"], t_end=[], atomic_facts=["John Doe's marriage is happening on 26-02-2026."])

### ⚡ Directives
- Extract strictly what is in the text. Do not hallucinate external facts.
- Use the **Observation Date** as the anchor for all relative temporal expressions.
- Maintain consistency: The same entity name should be used across multiple relations.
- Ensure `atomic_facts` contains exact copies of the source text strings.
