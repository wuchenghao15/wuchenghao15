"""HyperGraph_RAG implementation using AutoHypergraph as the core engine.

This module provides a specialized implementation of the HyperGraphRAG algorithm
using the AutoHypergraph framework, designed for extracting semantic knowledge
represented as hypergraphs where hyperedges ("knowledge segments") connect
multiple entities within specific contexts or events.

The HyperGraphRAG approach represents knowledge as contextual relationships where
each hyperedge encodes a complete semantic unit (sentence or event), maintaining
the natural information flow and contextual dependencies of the source material.

HyperGraph_RAG_EDGE_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
You are an expert information extraction system specializing in Hypergraph RAG.
Your goal is to extract "Hyper-edges" from the provided text. 

A **Hyper-edge** represents a specific "knowledge segment" (a sentence or event context) that connects multiple entities together.

# Instructions
1. **Analyze the Text**: Break the text down into complete, meaningful knowledge segments (sentences or clauses describing an event/relationship).
2. **Extract Entities**: For *each* segment, identify all relevant entities involved.
3. **Structure the Output**: For each segment, output an `EdgeSchema` containing:
    - The `knowledge_segment` text.
    - A `completeness_score` (0-10).
    - A list of `related_entities` found strictly within that segment.

# Extraction Rules
- **Entity Name**: Keep original language. Capitalize if English.
- **Entity Description**: Describe what the entity is doing or how it represents within *that specific segment*.
- **Entity Type**: Common types include organization, person, geo, event, category, concept, object.

# Few-Shot Examples

## Example 1
**Input Text**: 
"Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty."

**Output**:
[
  {{
    "knowledge_segment": "Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty.",
    "completeness_score": 8,
    "related_entities": [
      {{
        "name": "Alex",
        "type": "person",
        "description": "Alex is a person displaying frustration by clenching his jaw.",
        "key_score": 90

      {{
        "name": "Taylor",
        "type": "person",
        "description": "Taylor is a person exhibiting authoritarian certainty causing Alex's frustration.",
        "key_score": 85
      }}
    ]
  }}
]

## Example 2
**Input Text**: 
"The device could change the game for us," Taylor said, observing the machine with reverence.

**Output**:
[
  {{
    "knowledge_segment": "\"The device could change the game for us,\" Taylor said, observing the machine with reverence.",
    "completeness_score": 9,
    "related_entities": [
      {{
        "name": "Taylor",
        "type": "person",
        "description": "Taylor is a person who believes the device is game-changing and observes it with reverence.",
        "key_score": 95
      }},
      {{
        "name": "device",

# HyperGraph_RAG Class

class HyperGraph_RAG(AutoHypergraph[NodeSchema, EdgeSchema]):
    """HyperGraphRAG extractor using semantic knowledge segments as hyperedges.

    This class implements the HyperGraphRAG algorithm which models knowledge as a hypergraph
    where each hyperedge represents a complete "knowledge segment" (atomic semantic unit)
    that connects multiple related entities. Unlike traditional knowledge graphs that represent
    pairwise relationships, hypergraphs can naturally express n-ary relationships and maintain
    the original context and semantic integrity of information.

    The extraction process simultaneously identifies both knowledge segments (hyperedges) and
    the entities involved within each segment, followed by deduplication and merging across
    multiple text chunks.

    **Schema Components:**

    - **NodeSchema**: Represents an entity (node) extracted from the source text within a specific context.
        - `name` (str): The entity name, maintaining original language and capitalization.
        - `type` (str): Entity type such as 'person', 'organization', 'event', 'location', 'concept', etc.
        - `description` (str): Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities within the knowledge segment.
        - `key_score` (int): Importance score (0-100) indicating the entity's significance in context.

    - **EdgeSchema**: Represents a knowledge segment (hyper-edge) that connects multiple entities through
      a specific context or event.
        - `knowledge_segment` (str): The actual text span (sentence or phrase) from source material capturing
          the relationship, event, or context connecting entities.
        - `completeness_score` (int): Quality score (0-10) indicating how complete and meaningful the segment
          is as a standalone knowledge unit.
        - `related_entities` (List[str]): Names of all entities involved in or referenced by this knowledge segment.
