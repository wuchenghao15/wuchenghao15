            top_k: If provided, sets both top_k_nodes and top_k_edges to this value.
            use_community: If True, enables community-aware search.
                          Requires networkx and graspologic. Default: False.
            source_ids: Optional scope — only knowledge contributed by these

            tags: Optional scope — only knowledge from sources carrying any
                of these tags.

        Returns:
