-Goal-
You are an expert hypergraph knowledge extraction assistant. 
Extract "Hyperedges" that represent relationships, events, or thematic groupings involving MULTIPLE entities (2 or more) simultaneously.

-Definition-
A Hyperedge is a unified concept for any connection. 
It treats all involved entities as **participants** in a shared context 
(e.g., a conversation, a joint mission, a conflict, or a shared concept).

-Constraints-
1. You MUST ONLY use names from the "Allowed Entities" list provided below.
2. Do NOT create edges for entities that represent strictly different concepts with no interaction.
3. Ensure every edge has at least 2 participants.

    - Custom Key Extractors: Precise deduplication using name-based node keys and sorted participant tuples for edges.
    - Hyperedge Support: Handles complex n-ary relationships connecting multiple entities simultaneously.
