# Auto-Types

Understanding the 9 knowledge structure types: what they are and when to use them.

---

## What Are Auto-Types?

Auto-Types are intelligent data structures that define how extracted knowledge is organized. Think of them as "containers" that shape what comes out of your documents.

Key characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Type-Safe** | Pydantic-based validation ensures consistent data |
| **Self-Contained** | Built-in operations (search, visualize, save) |
| **Serializable** | Save to disk, load later |
| **Composable** | Merge, update, extend incrementally |

    D --> D1[AutoDocument<br/>Chunk-level retrieval,<br/>zero extraction cost]
```

## Record Types

For **recording and storing data** without relationships between entities.

Record types extract **independent data items**, where each item does not contain information about its relationship to other items.

### AutoModel

**Purpose**: Extract a single structured object

**Think of it as**: A form with fields you want to fill in

**Example use cases**:

- Company earnings report (revenue, profit, growth)
- Product specification (name, price, features)
- Person profile (name, birth date, occupation)

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "company_name": "Tesla Inc",
    "revenue": 81.46,
    "employees": 127855
}
```

**Common templates**: `finance/earnings_summary`, `general/model`

---

### AutoList

**Purpose**: Extract an ordered collection

**Think of it as**: A ranked list or sequence

**Example use cases**:

- Top 10 movies of all time
- Step-by-step procedures
- Timeline events (simple chronological list)

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {"name": "Tesla Coil", "year": 1891},
        {"name": "Radio", "year": 1898}
    ]
}
```

**Key property**: Order matters - items are in sequence

**Common templates**: `general/list`, `legal/compliance_list`

---

### AutoSet

**Purpose**: Extract unique items (no duplicates)

**Think of it as**: A bag of unique tags

**Example use cases**:

- Keywords from a document
- Categories or tags
- Skill sets

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "items": ["Electrical Engineering", "Physics", "Invention"]
}
```

**Key property**: Duplicates are automatically removed

**Common templates**: `general/set`, `finance/risk_factor_set`

---

## Graph Types

For representing **relationships between entities**. Graph types include both the entities themselves (nodes) and the connections between them (edges).

Graph types are divided into subtypes based on relationship complexity and additional dimensional information:

### Basic Graphs

#### AutoGraph

**Purpose**: Extract binary relationships (two entities at a time)

**Think of it as**: A social network diagram

**Example use cases**:

- People and their connections (worked with, married to)
- Concepts and their relationships (is-a, part-of)
- Organizations and interactions

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "nodes": [
        {"name": "Tesla", "type": "person"},
        {"name": "AC Motor", "type": "invention"}
    ],
    "edges": [
        {"source": "Tesla", "target": "AC Motor", "type": "invented"}
    ]
}
```

**Key property**: Every relationship connects exactly two entities

**Common templates**: `general/graph`, `general/biography_graph`

---

#### AutoHypergraph

**Purpose**: Extract relationships involving 3+ entities

**Think of it as**: A project team where multiple people collaborate

**Example use cases**:

- Multi-party collaborations
- Complex interactions (buyer, seller, broker)
- Group memberships

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "nodes": [...],
    "edges": [
        {
            "entities": ["Tesla", "Westinghouse", "Niagara"],
            "type": "collaboration"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key property**: One "edge" can connect multiple entities

**Common template**: `general/base_hypergraph`

---

### Enhanced Graphs (with dimensional information)

Built on basic graphs with added **time** or **space** dimensions for richer relationship descriptions.

#### AutoTemporalGraph (Temporal Graph)

**Purpose**: Extract relationships with time information

**Think of it as**: A timeline with connections

**Example use cases**:

- Biographies (life events with dates)
- Project histories
- Historical analysis

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "edges": [
        {
            "source": "Tesla",
            "target": "AC Motor",
            "type": "invented",
            "time": "1888"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key property**: Every relationship has a time component

**Common templates**: `general/base_temporal_graph`, `finance/event_timeline`

---

#### AutoSpatialGraph (Spatial Graph)

**Purpose**: Extract relationships with location information

**Think of it as**: A map with connections

**Example use cases**:

- Travel logs
- Geographic networks
- Location-based asset tracking

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "entities": [
        {"name": "Colorado Springs", "location": "38.83,-104.82"}
    ],
    "relations": [
        {
            "source": "Tesla",
            "target": "Colorado Springs",
            "type": "conducted_experiments"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key property**: Entities or relationships have geographic coordinates

**Common template**: `general/base_spatial_graph`

---

#### AutoSpatioTemporalGraph (Spatio-Temporal Graph)

**Purpose**: Extract relationships with both time and location

**Think of it as**: A historical map with dated events

**Example use cases**:

- Military history (battles with when and where)
- Epidemic tracking
- Historical migrations

**Example output structure**:

```json
{
    "relations": [
        {
            "source": "Tesla",
            "target": "AC Motor",
            "type": "demonstrated",
            "time": "1888",
            "location": "Pittsburgh"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Key property**: Complete context - who, what, when, and where

**Common template**: `general/base_spatio_temporal_graph`

---

## Corpus Type

For **raw chunk-level retrieval** without any LLM extraction.

### AutoDocument

**Purpose**: Store documents as retrievable text chunks

**Think of it as**: A smart, searchable archive of your documents

**Example use cases**:

- Quick Q&A over a document corpus
- A baseline before investing in structured extraction
- Cost-sensitive ingestion of very large collections

**Key property**: Zero LLM cost at ingestion — chunks are embedded as-is; search returns raw text. Full provenance support (tags, scoped search, per-document rollback).

**Common method**: `method/chunk_rag`

---
