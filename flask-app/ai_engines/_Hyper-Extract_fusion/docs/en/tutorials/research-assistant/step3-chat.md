# Step 3: Q&A System

Create an interactive Q&A interface.

---

## Goal

Build a conversational interface that answers questions about the research paper using natural language.

---

## How It Works

1. User asks a question
2. System retrieves relevant context from knowledge abstract
3. LLM generates answer based on retrieved context
4. Response includes citations from the paper

---

## Using CLI

### Single Question

```bash
he talk ./paper_kb/ -q "What are the main contributions of this paper?"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
he talk ./paper_kb/ -i
```

**Example Session:**
```
Entering interactive mode. Type 'exit' or 'quit' to stop.

> What is the Transformer architecture?

The Transformer is a novel neural network architecture introduced in 
this paper that relies entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing 
with recurrence and convolutions entirely...

> How does it compare to RNNs?

Unlike RNNs, which process sequences sequentially, the Transformer 
processes all positions in parallel, making it more efficient for 
training on large datasets...

> exit
```

## Using Python

### Script

```python
"""Step 3: Interactive Q&A system."""

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

from hyperextract import Template

KB_DIR = "./paper_kb/"

class ResearchAssistant:
    def __init__(self, ka_path):
        print("Loading research assistant...")
        self.ka = Template.create("general/concept_graph", "en")
        self.ka.load(ka_path)
        self.ka.build_index()
        print("✓ Ready!\n")
    
    def ask(self, question, top_k=5):
        """Ask a question about the paper."""
        response = self.ka.chat(question, top_k=top_k)
        return response.content
    
    def interactive(self):
        """Run interactive Q&A session."""
        print("="*60)
        print("Research Assistant - Ask me about the paper!")
        print("="*60)
        print("Type 'quit' to exit\n")
        
        while True:
            question = input("\nQ: ").strip()
            
            if question.lower() in ['quit', 'exit', 'q']:
                break
            
            if not question:
                continue
            
            print("\nThinking...")
            answer = self.ask(question)
            print(f"\nA: {answer}\n")
            print("-"*60)
        
        print("\nGoodbye!")

def main():
    assistant = ResearchAssistant(KB_DIR)
    assistant.interactive()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- "How is positional encoding handled?"

### Results and Evaluation

- "What datasets were used?"
- "What were the main results?"
- "How does it compare to baseline methods?"

### Limitations and Future Work

- "What are the limitations?"
- "What future work is suggested?"

---

## Advanced Features

### Citation Tracking

```python
def ask_with_citations(assistant, question):
    """Get answer with source citations."""
    response = assistant.ka.chat(question, top_k=5)
    
    print(f"Answer: {response.content}\n")
    
    # Show retrieved sources
    retrieved_nodes = response.additional_kwargs.get("retrieved_nodes", [])
    retrieved_edges = response.additional_kwargs.get("retrieved_edges", [])
    if retrieved_nodes or retrieved_edges:
        print("Sources:")
        for node in retrieved_nodes:
            print(f"  - {node.name}")
        for edge in retrieved_edges:
            print(f"  - {edge.source} -> {edge.target}")
```

### Question Suggestions

```python
def suggest_questions(assistant):
    """Suggest questions based on paper content."""
    suggestions = [
        "What are the main contributions?",
        "What problem does this solve?",
        "What are the key results?",
        "How does this compare to prior work?",
    ]
    return suggestions
```

### Exporting Q&A History

```python
def export_history(questions_answers, filename="qa_history.json"):
    """Export Q&A session to file."""
    import json
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(questions_answers, f, indent=2)
```

## Complete Application
