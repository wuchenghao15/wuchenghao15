**The knowledge graph for your codebase — explore it visually, or let your AI agent query it.**

Indexes any codebase into a structural knowledge graph — every dependency, call chain, cluster, and execution flow. Explore it through an **interactive web dashboard** with force-directed graph visualization, or expose it through **MCP tools** so AI agents get full structural understanding in every tool call.

```
$ axon analyze .

Walking files...               142 files found
Parsing code...                142/142
Tracing calls...               847 calls resolved
Analyzing types...             234 type relationships
Detecting communities...       8 clusters found
Detecting execution flows...   34 processes found
Finding dead code...           12 unreachable symbols
Analyzing git history...       18 coupled file pairs
Generating embeddings...       623 vectors stored

Done in 4.2s — 623 symbols, 1,847 edges, 8 clusters, 34 flows
```

Then explore your codebase visually:

```bash
axon ui                      # Opens interactive dashboard at localhost:8420
```

**Three views, one command:**

- **Explorer** — Interactive force-directed graph (Sigma.js + WebGL). Click any node to see its code, callers, callees, impact radius, and community. Community hull overlays show architectural clusters at a glance.
- **Analysis** — Health score, coupling heatmap, dead code report, inheritance tree, branch diff — your codebase health in one dashboard.
- **Cypher Console** — Write and run Cypher queries against the graph with syntax highlighting, presets, and history.

Plus: command palette (`Cmd+K`), keyboard shortcuts, flow trace animations, graph minimap, and SSE-powered live reload when watch mode is active.

---

## The Problem

Your AI agent edits `UserService.validate()`. It doesn't know that 47 functions depend on that return type, 3 execution flows pass through it, and `payment_handler.py` changes alongside it 80% of the time.

**Breaking changes ship.**

This happens because AI agents work with flat text. They grep for callers, miss indirect ones, and have no understanding of how code is *connected*. Context windows are finite. LSPs don't expose call graphs. Grepping gives you strings, not structure.

The agent needs a **knowledge graph** — not more text.

---

## How Axon Solves It

Most code intelligence tools give the agent raw files and hope it reads enough. Axon takes a different approach: **precompute structure at index time** so every tool call returns complete, actionable context.

A 12-phase pipeline runs once over your repo. After that:

- `axon_impact("validate")` returns all 47 affected symbols, grouped by depth (will break / may break / review), with confidence scores — in a single call
- `axon_query("auth handler")` returns hybrid-ranked results grouped by execution flow, not a flat list of name matches
- `axon_context("UserService")` returns callers, callees, type references, community membership, and dead code status — the full picture

**Three benefits:**

1. **Reliability** — the context is already in the tool response. No multi-step exploration that can miss code.
2. **Token efficiency** — one tool call instead of a 10-query search chain. Agents spend tokens on reasoning, not navigation.
3. **Model democratization** — even smaller models get full architectural clarity because the tools do the heavy lifting.

**Zero cloud dependencies.** Everything runs locally — parsing, graph storage, embeddings, search. No API keys, no data leaving your machine.

---

## TL;DR

```bash
pip install axoniq            # 1. Install
cd your-project && axon analyze .  # 2. Index (one command, ~5s for most repos)
axon ui                       # 3. Explore visually at localhost:8420
```

**For AI agents** — add to `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axon": {
      "command": "axon",
      "args": ["serve", "--watch"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For developers** — explore the graph yourself:

```bash
axon ui                      # Interactive dashboard (standalone or attaches to running host)
axon ui --watch              # Live reload on file changes
axon host --watch            # Shared host: UI + multi-session MCP
```

---

## What You Get

### Explore your codebase visually

**Web UI**

A full interactive dashboard — no terminal or extensions required. One command:

```bash
axon ui                           # Launch at localhost:8420
axon ui --watch                   # Live reload on file changes
axon ui --port 9000               # Custom port
axon ui --dev                     # Dev mode (Vite HMR on :5173)
```

| View | What It Shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Explorer** | Interactive force-directed graph (Sigma.js + WebGL), file tree sidebar, symbol detail panel with code preview, callers/callees, impact analysis, and process memberships. Community hull overlays reveal architectural clusters. |
| **Analysis** | Health score, coupling heatmap, dead code report, inheritance tree visualization, branch diff, and aggregate stats — your codebase health at a glance. |
| **Cypher Console** | Query editor with syntax highlighting, preset query library, results table, and query history. |

**Extras:** Command palette (`Cmd+K`), keyboard shortcuts, graph minimap, flow trace and impact ripple animations, SSE-powered live reload when watch mode is enabled.

The UI is backed by a FastAPI server with a full REST API — see [API Endpoints](#api-endpoints) below.

### Find anything — by name, concept, or typo

**Hybrid Search (BM25 + Vector + Fuzzy)**

Three search strategies fused with [Reciprocal Rank Fusion](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf):

- **BM25 full-text search** — fast exact name and keyword matching via KuzuDB FTS
- **Semantic vector search** — conceptual queries via 384-dim embeddings (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5)
- **Fuzzy name search** — Levenshtein fallback for typos and partial matches

Results are ranked with test file down-ranking (0.5x) and source function/class boosting (1.2x), then **grouped by execution flow** so the agent sees architectural context in a single call.

### Know what breaks before you change it

**Impact Analysis with Depth Grouping**

When you're about to change a symbol, Axon traces upstream through the call graph, type references, and git coupling history. Results are grouped by depth for actionability:

- **Depth 1** — Direct callers (will break)
- **Depth 2** — Indirect callers (may break)
- **Depth 3+** — Transitive (review)

Every edge carries a confidence score (1.0 = exact match, 0.8 = receiver method, 0.5 = fuzzy) so you can prioritize what to review.

### Find what to delete

**Dead Code Detection**

Not just "zero callers" — a multi-pass analysis that understands your framework:

1. **Initial scan** — flags symbols with no incoming calls
2. **Exemptions** — entry points, exports, constructors, test code, dunder methods, `__init__.py` symbols, decorated functions, `@property` methods
3. **Override pass** — un-flags methods overriding non-dead base class methods
4. **Protocol conformance** — un-flags methods on Protocol-conforming classes
5. **Protocol stubs** — un-flags all methods on Protocol classes (interface contracts)

### Understand how code runs, not just where it sits

**Execution Flow Tracing**

Detects entry points using framework-aware patterns:
- **Python**: `@app.route`, `@router.get`, `@click.command`, `test_*` functions, `__main__` blocks
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Express handlers, exported functions, `handler`/`middleware` patterns

Then traces BFS execution flows from each entry point through the call graph, classifying flows as intra-community or cross-community.

### See your architecture without reading docs

**Community Detection**

Uses the [Leiden algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-41695-z) (igraph + leidenalg) to automatically discover functional clusters. Each community gets a cohesion score and auto-generated label. Agents can ask "what cluster does this symbol belong to?" and get the answer without reading a single design doc.

### Find hidden dependencies git knows about

**Change Coupling (Git History)**

Analyzes 6 months of git history to find dependencies that static analysis misses:

```
coupling(A, B) = co_changes(A, B) / max(changes(A), changes(B))
```

Files with coupling strength >= 0.3 and 3+ co-changes get linked. These show up in impact analysis — so when you change `user.py`, the agent also knows to check `user_test.py` and `auth_middleware.py`.

### Always up to date

**Watch Mode**

Live re-indexing powered by a Rust-based file watcher (watchfiles):

```bash
$ axon watch
Watching /Users/you/project for changes...

[10:32:15] src/auth/validate.py modified -> re-indexed (0.3s)
[10:33:02] 2 files modified -> re-indexed (0.5s)
```

File-local phases (parse, imports, calls, types) run immediately on change. Global phases (communities, processes, dead code) batch every 30 seconds.

### Structural diff, not text diff

**Branch Comparison**

Compare branches at the symbol level using git worktrees (no stashing required):

```bash
$ axon diff main..feature

Symbols added (4):
  + process_payment (Function) -- src/payments/stripe.py
  + PaymentIntent (Class) -- src/payments/models.py

Symbols modified (2):
  ~ checkout_handler (Function) -- src/routes/checkout.py

Symbols removed (1):
  - old_charge (Function) -- src/payments/legacy.py
```

### Clean call graphs

**Noise Filtering**

Built-in blocklist (138 entries) automatically filters language builtins (`print`, `len`, `isinstance`), JS/TS globals (`console`, `setTimeout`, `fetch`), React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and common stdlib methods from the call graph. Your graph shows *your* code's relationships, not noise from `list.append()`.

---

## The Pipeline

Axon builds deep structural understanding through 12 sequential analysis phases:

| Phase | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **File Walking** | Walks repo respecting `.gitignore`, filters by supported languages |
| **Structure** | Creates File/Folder hierarchy with CONTAINS relationships |
| **Parsing** | tree-sitter AST extraction — functions, classes, methods, interfaces, enums, type aliases |
| **Import Resolution** | Resolves import statements to actual files (relative, absolute, bare specifiers) |
| **Call Tracing** | Maps function calls with confidence scores. Noise filtering skips 138 language builtins |
| **Heritage** | Tracks class inheritance (EXTENDS) and interface implementation (IMPLEMENTS) |
| **Type Analysis** | Extracts type references from parameters, return types, and variable annotations |
| **Community Detection** | Leiden algorithm clusters related symbols into functional communities |
| **Process Detection** | Framework-aware entry point detection + BFS flow tracing |
| **Dead Code Detection** | Multi-pass analysis with override, protocol, and decorator awareness |
| **Change Coupling** | Git history analysis — finds files that always change together |
| **Embeddings** | 384-dim vectors for every symbol, enabling semantic search. Skip with `--no-embeddings` |

---

## MCP Integration

Axon exposes its full intelligence as an MCP server. Set it up once, and your AI agent has structural understanding of your codebase forever.

### Setup

**Claude Code** — add to `.mcp.json` in your project root (or run `claude mcp add axon -- axon serve --watch`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "axon": {
      "command": "axon",
      "args": ["serve", "--watch"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** — add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "axon": {
    "command": "axon",
    "args": ["serve", "--watch"]
  }
}
```

Optional new feature:

```bash
axon host --watch
```

This starts a shared host for the UI and multiple MCP clients. `axon setup --claude` / `axon setup --cursor` still prints the standard config.

The `--watch` flag enables live re-indexing — the graph updates as you edit code.

### Tools

| Tool | What the agent gets |
|------|-------------|
| `axon_query` | Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + fuzzy) with results grouped by execution flow |
| `axon_context` | 360-degree view — callers, callees, type refs, confidence tags, dead code status |
| `axon_impact` | Blast radius grouped by depth — direct (will break), indirect (may break), transitive |
| `axon_dead_code` | All unreachable symbols grouped by file |
| `axon_detect_changes` | Map a `git diff` to affected symbols and execution flows |
| `axon_list_repos` | All indexed repositories with stats |
| `axon_cypher` | Read-only Cypher queries against the knowledge graph |

Every tool response includes a **next-step hint** guiding the agent through a natural investigation workflow:

```
query   -> "Next: Use context() on a specific symbol for the full picture."
context -> "Next: Use impact() if planning changes to this symbol."
impact  -> "Tip: Review each affected symbol before making changes."
```

### Resources

| URI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `axon://overview` | Node and relationship counts by type |
| `axon://dead-code` | Full dead code report |
| `axon://schema` | Graph schema reference for Cypher queries |

---

## API Endpoints

The web UI is backed by a FastAPI server. All endpoints are under `/api`:

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GET /api/graph` | Full knowledge graph (paginated) |
| `GET /api/node/{id}` | Node detail with callers, callees, type refs |
| `GET /api/overview` | Aggregate node/edge counts |
| `GET /api/search` | Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + fuzzy) |
| `GET /api/impact/{id}` | Blast radius analysis by depth |
| `GET /api/dead-code` | Dead code report |
| `GET /api/communities` | Community listing with members |
| `GET /api/coupling` | Change coupling heatmap data |
| `GET /api/files/{path}` | Source file content with syntax context |
| `POST /api/cypher` | Execute read-only Cypher queries |
| `GET /api/diff` | Structural branch comparison |
| `GET /api/processes` | Execution flow listing |
| `GET /api/events` | SSE stream for live reload events |
| `POST /api/reindex` | Trigger a full re-index (watch mode only) |

Cypher queries are validated server-side — write keywords (`CREATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, etc.) are rejected after comment stripping.

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Parsing | tree-sitter | Language-agnostic AST extraction |
| Graph Storage | KuzuDB | Embedded graph database with Cypher, FTS, and vector support |
| Graph Algorithms | igraph + leidenalg | Leiden community detection |
| Embeddings | fastembed | ONNX-based 384-dim vectors (~100MB, no PyTorch) |
| MCP Protocol | mcp SDK (FastMCP) | AI agent communication via stdio |
| Web Backend | FastAPI + Uvicorn | REST API for the web UI, SSE for live updates |
| Web Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite | Interactive dashboard with Tailwind CSS |
| Graph Visualization | Sigma.js + Graphology | WebGL graph rendering with ForceAtlas2 layout |
| CLI | Typer + Rich | Terminal interface with progress bars |
| File Watching | watchfiles | Rust-based file system watcher |
| Gitignore | pathspec | Full `.gitignore` pattern matching |

### Storage

Everything lives locally:

```
your-project/
+-- .axon/
    +-- kuzu/          # KuzuDB graph database (graph + FTS + vectors)
    +-- meta.json      # Index metadata and stats
```

Add `.axon/` to your `.gitignore`.

A global registry at `~/.axon/repos/` is automatically populated on `axon analyze`, enabling `axon list` to discover all indexed repositories across your machine.

The storage layer is abstracted behind a `StorageBackend` Protocol — KuzuDB is the default, with an optional Neo4j backend available via `pip install axoniq[neo4j]`.
