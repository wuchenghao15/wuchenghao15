"""Phase 11: Change Coupling Analysis for Axon.

Analyzes git history to discover files that frequently change together.
Co-change frequency is a strong indicator of logical coupling -- files that
must be modified in tandem likely share implicit dependencies that may not
be visible in static analysis alone.

The main entry point is :func:`process_coupling`, which parses the git log,
builds a co-change matrix, computes coupling strengths, and writes
``COUPLED_WITH`` relationships into the knowledge graph.
