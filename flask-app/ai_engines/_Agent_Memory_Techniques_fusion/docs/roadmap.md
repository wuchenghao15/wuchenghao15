# Project Roadmap

> **This is the original planning document that guided construction.** For the current state of the project, see [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md). The phase statuses below are historical.


This document outlines the planned phases for the Agent Memory Techniques repository. Each phase builds on the previous one. We progress from foundational notebooks through cognitive architectures, framework integrations, and production-grade evaluation.

**Current status:** Phase 1 (in progress).

## Phase 5: Community Contributions and Advanced Topics

**Status: Future**

This phase opens the repository to community contributions. It also explores emerging topics in agent memory.

### Community Contribution Areas

- **New technique implementations:** Community members implement notebooks for techniques from Phases 1-4.
- **Alternative framework integrations:** LlamaIndex memory modules, AutoGen memory, CrewAI memory, custom solutions.
- **Language ports:** Implementations in TypeScript/JavaScript, Rust, Go for non-Python ecosystems.
- **Benchmark contributions:** New evaluation datasets, domain-specific benchmarks, adversarial memory tests.
- **Case studies:** Real-world production memory systems, lessons learned, failure modes.

### Advanced Topics Under Consideration

We may add these topics as notebooks beyond the initial 30, depending on community interest and the evolving landscape.

| Topic | Description | Why It Matters |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Memory for multimodal agents** | Storing and retrieving image, audio, and video memories alongside text. Multimodal embeddings, vision-language memory stores, cross-modal retrieval. | As agents become multimodal, memory systems need to handle non-text data natively. |
| **Memory in agentic coding assistants** | How tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot Workspace, and Devin manage memory across coding sessions. Project context, code understanding, user preference learning, cross-file reasoning. | Coding assistants are the most widely deployed agents in 2026. Their memory needs are unique. |
| **Federated memory across organizations** | Sharing memory patterns across organizational boundaries while preserving privacy. Federated learning for memory models, differential privacy in memory stores, secure multi-party computation for shared entities. | Enterprise agents increasingly need to collaborate across company boundaries. |
| **Memory for autonomous agents** | Long-horizon memory for agents that run for hours or days without human interaction. Self-monitoring, drift detection, memory corruption recovery, autonomous consolidation. | As agents become more autonomous, their memory systems must be self-maintaining. |
| **Neuromorphic memory patterns** | Bio-inspired memory architectures: Hebbian learning ("neurons that fire together wire together"), sparse distributed memory, complementary learning systems (hippocampus + neocortex model). | These patterns may unlock more efficient and reliable memory systems. |
| **Memory-aware fine-tuning** | Using memory interaction logs to fine-tune the base model for better memory operations. Learning to summarize, extract, route, and retrieve through training rather than prompting. | Prompting-based memory has limits. Fine-tuning may break through performance ceilings. |
| **Memory security and adversarial resilience** | Protecting memory from prompt injection attacks that attempt to poison stored memories, extract private information, or manipulate entity records. | As agents handle sensitive data, memory security becomes a critical concern. |
